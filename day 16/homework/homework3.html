        YouTube is a video portal where users can upload and share videos with each other. It was created in February 2005 by three former PayPal employees, and in November 2006, Google acquired it for $1.65 billion. Today, it operates as a subsidiary of Google. The company was founded in San Bruno, California, and uses Adobe Flash Player and HTML5 technologies to stream a variety of user-uploaded video content. This includes movie and TV clips, music videos, as well as amateur content such as video blogging and short original videos. Most videos on YouTube are uploaded by individuals, though media corporations like CBS, BBC, UMG, and others also offer their content through YouTube as part of its partnership program.

        Unregistered users can only view videos, while registered users can upload unlimited videos, rate them, and leave comments. Videos that may contain offensive or inappropriate content are age-restricted to viewers over 18. Uploading videos that include defamation, pornography, copyright violations, or incitement to crime is prohibited by YouTube’s terms of service.

        YouTube’s slogan is: Broadcast Yourself.
