        <strong>Football</strong> is a team sport in which two teams of eleven players each compete against each other. The game is played on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The objective is to maneuver the ball among teammates to score goals in the opposing team's net. According to the main rule of the sport, players (except the goalkeeper) are not allowed to use their hands or arms to touch the ball during play. The team that scores more goals by the end of the match wins.

        There is one main referee and four assistant referees in football, including 2 sideline assistants and 2 goal-line assistants. The main referee has the authority to decide whether to penalize a team for rule violations during the game. The referee can issue a yellow or red card, depending on how serious the foul was. A player who receives two yellow cards or a direct red card must leave the field and is automatically suspended for the team's next match in that specific tournament. <b>If a player receives a red card for unsportsmanlike conduct, they may be suspended for multiple games (the case is reviewed by UEFA or FIFA’s disciplinary committee).</b>

        The modern form of football was developed in England, followed by the creation of the Football Association. The rules drafted in 1863 led to the sport's global development as it is played today. <strong>The international governing body of football is FIFA (French: Fédération Internationale de Football Association; acronym – FIFA).</strong> The most prestigious football competition is the FIFA World Cup, which holds the largest global viewership among all sporting events.
