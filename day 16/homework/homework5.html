    <p><b>Wentworth Earl Miller III (born June 2, 1972) is an American actor best known for his role as Michael Scofield in *Prison Break*, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor – Television Series Drama in 2005. He debuted as a screenwriter with the 2013 film *Stoker*. In 2014, he began playing Leonard Snart / Captain Cold in a recurring role on *The Flash*, before becoming a main cast member in the spin-off series *Legends of Tomorrow*.

        Early Life  
        Miller was born in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, England, to American parents. His mother, Roxann (née Palm), is a special education teacher, and his father, Wentworth E. Miller II, is a lawyer and teacher who was studying at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar at the time of Miller’s birth. In 2003, Miller stated that his father is Black and his mother is white. His father's ancestry includes African-American, Jamaican, German, and English roots; his mother is of Rusyn, Swedish, French, Dutch, Syrian, and Lebanese descent. He has two sisters, Leigh and Gillian.

        His family moved to Park Slope, Brooklyn, when he was one year old. He attended Midwood High School in Brooklyn and graduated from Princeton University in 1995 with a bachelor’s degree in English after completing a 116-page senior thesis titled *Doubling and the Construction of Identity in Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “The Yellow Wallpaper,” and Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë*, under the supervision of Gina Dent. At Princeton, he sang with the a cappella group the Princeton Tigertones and was a member of the Quadrangle Club and the Colonial Club.

        Career

        In 1995, Miller moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. He stated that his path to stardom was "long and rocky, with lots of hardship, failure, and roadblocks, but I couldn't walk away from it. I needed it like I needed air. It was just something I had to do." His first television appearance was as Gage Petronzi, a student turned sea monster, on *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* ("Go Fish", 1998).

        Miller's first major role came in 2002 as the sensitive, introverted David Scott in the ABC mini-series *Dinotopia*. After several minor television roles, he appeared in the 2003 film *The Human Stain*, portraying the younger version of Anthony Hopkins' character, Coleman Silk. He embodied the film's central dilemma—a Black man who chooses to "pass" as white. Miller thoroughly prepared for the role by studying Hopkins and undergoing a four-month regimen to authentically portray Silk as a boxer. Also in 2003, he played a small role in *Underworld* as a doctor and friend to the character Michael Corvin.

        In 2005, Miller starred as Michael Scofield in the Fox television drama *Prison Break*. He portrayed a talented structural engineer who devises an elaborate plan to help his brother, Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell), escape death row after being wrongfully convicted. His character featured an intricate full-body tattoo. The special effects tattoo took four hours to apply and covered Miller’s chest, back, and both arms. His performance earned him a 2005 Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Drama Series. The show ended in 2009 after four seasons, but a nine-episode fifth season aired on April 4, 2017, with Miller reprising his role.

        Miller appeared in two Mariah Carey music videos, "It's Like That" as a party guest and "We Belong Together" as her love interest. Director Brett Ratner, who directed the *Prison Break* pilot, also directed Carey’s two videos and chose to cast Miller in them.

        Additionally, Miller starred in the season 11 premiere of *Law & Order: Special Victims Unit* as Detective Nate Kendall of the NYPD’s 24th precinct. He also appeared in *Resident Evil: Afterlife*, the fourth film in the commercially successful *Resident Evil* series based on the video games; Miller played Chris Redfield, a major character in the game series.

        Miller wrote the screenplay for the film *Stoker* and its prequel *Uncle Charlie*. He used the pseudonym Ted Foulke, later explaining: "I just wanted the scripts to sink or swim on their own." His screenplay was listed in the 2010 Black List of the 10 best unproduced scripts in Hollywood. The story follows a teenage girl who, after her father’s death, has to deal with a mysterious uncle. Miller described it as "a horror film, a family drama, and a psychological thriller." Although influenced by *Dracula* by Bram Stoker, Miller clarified that *Stoker* is not a vampire story. Alfred Hitchcock’s *Shadow of a Doubt* also inspired the film. Directed by Park Chan-wook, it starred Mia Wasikowska as the teen, Nicole Kidman as her mother, and Matthew Goode as the uncle. The film was released in 2013 and received generally positive reviews from critics.

        In July 2014, it was announced that Miller joined the cast of the CW superhero series in a recurring role as Leonard Snart / Captain Cold. He first appeared in the fourth episode of *The Flash* and reprised the role in *Legends of Tomorrow*. These shows reunited him with *Prison Break* co-star Dominic Purcell, who portrayed Mick Rory / Heat Wave. At the end of the first season, Miller left *Legends* as a series regular but signed a deal with Warner Bros. TV to continue portraying Snart across multiple Arrowverse series.

        Miller wrote the screenplay for the 2016 horror film *The Disappointments Room*, produced by Voltage Pictures and Killer Films. The film received negative reviews from critics. He reportedly entered negotiations to adapt David Wroblewski’s novel *The Story of Edgar Sawtelle* into a screenplay, with Oprah Winfrey and Tom Hanks among the producers.

        In 2013, Miller came out as gay and in 2020 announced he was no longer interested in playing straight characters in film or television and would not be involved in *Prison Break* Season 6, if produced.

        In 2023, an audiobook version of the 1995 book *Prayers for Bobby* was released on Audible, narrated by Miller. In 2024, it was reported that he would reunite with *Prison Break* co-star Dominic Purcell in a new hostage-rescue drama titled *Snatchback*.

        Personal Life

        Miller resides in Vancouver, British Columbia. He holds dual U.S. and U.K. citizenship due to his American parents' birth.

        In 2007, Miller denied being gay in *InStyle* magazine. However, he came out publicly in August 2013 by posting a letter on GLAAD’s website rejecting an invitation to the St. Petersburg International Film Festival due to the Russian government's treatment of its LGBTQ citizens. Miller wrote that he was “deeply troubled” and that he “cannot in good conscience participate in a celebratory event hosted by a country where people like myself are being systematically denied their basic right to live and love openly.”

        At the 2013 Human Rights Campaign dinner in Seattle, Washington, Miller revealed that he had attempted suicide multiple times as a teenager before coming out. He said, "When someone asked me if it was a cry for help, I said no, because I didn’t tell anyone. You only cry for help if you believe there’s help to cry for." He discussed the challenges of being a closeted actor in Hollywood and how participating in the ManKind Project helped him understand brotherhood, sisterhood, and community.

        On October 17, 2016, the mental health charity Active Minds announced that Miller would become an ambassador for the organization. In a 2016 Facebook post, he revealed that he had "struggled with depression since childhood. It’s a battle that’s cost me time, opportunities, relationships, and thousands of sleepless nights." He wrote the emotional post in response to a meme mocking his weight gain in 2010, stating that he had turned to food for comfort while experiencing suicidal thoughts. At the end of the post, he provided links to resources such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Active Minds. On July 27, 2021, Miller revealed via Instagram that he had been diagnosed with autism “a year ago.” He wrote: “This isn’t something I’d change... Being autistic is central to who I am. To everything I’ve achieved/articulated.”</b></p>
